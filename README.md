Hey there, Shri here. I'm a fresher from chennai at IITG in the physics department. Ahhh umm..... past few weeks have been hectic so its just been coding and studying....but in general i love sports...i'm good at cricket and volleyball, i read, watch movies, binge anime and practically do everything that a teenager
loves and i love coding especially competitive programming (its been an adiction recently! ). Looking forward to meeting you all!

i would like to contribute to open source because it just fascinates me....i get to learn new skills....gain knowledge about what i'm working on....build up my reputation since i would get to contribute in very big projects which will also build my team working capabilities and overall ... open source is fun...and thats the main reason why i wanna contribute to it.
