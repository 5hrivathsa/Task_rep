Ahhh umm..... past few weeks have been hectic so its just been coding and studying....but in general i love sports...i'm good at cricket and volleyball, i read, watch movies, binge anime and practically do everything that a teenager
loves and i love coding especially competitive programming (its been an adiction recently! ). Looking forward to meeting you all!
